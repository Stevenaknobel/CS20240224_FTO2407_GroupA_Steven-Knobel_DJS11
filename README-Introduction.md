üéß The Podcast Hotspot | PORTFOLIO PROJECT üé§

Welcome to the Podcast App, a web-based application designed to mimic a podcast site for podcast enthusiasts to explore, listen, and manage their favorite podcast episodes. This application allows users to browse shows, seasons, and episodes, mark their favorite episodes, and easily access their favorites for later listening.


üöÄ Introduction

The Podcast App allows users to:

    Browse podcasts, seasons, and episodes from an API of over 50 different podcasts each with multiple seasons, with the ability to navigate through a modal for each season showing all episodes available.
    Play or pause podcast episodes.
    Add specific episodes to their favorites, which can then be viewed at a later date through the Navbar menu
    Filter podcasts by genres such as Comedy, History, News, and more, as well as filter based on fuzzy text and categorize to the users preference (A-Z, Z-A, Oldest or Newest)
    View a custom audio player to track their listening progress.

This app is built with React and JavaScript, leveraging hooks for managing state, and utilizes multiple external podcast API's to dynamically fetch and display podcast data. The app also includes state management for storing user preferences such as marked favorites.


üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    React for building the user interface.
    JavaScript and CSS for scripting and styling.
    Fetch API for making requests to the podcast API.
    Local Storage for persisting user favorites across sessions.
    React Router for navigation between pages.
    Netlify for hosting and deployment.
